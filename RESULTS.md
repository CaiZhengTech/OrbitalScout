Measured output only. Every number here came from a script in this repository and can be reproduced by running it. Anything not yet measured is marked `[TBD]` rather than estimated.

AOI: Story County, Iowa (FIPS 19169), 1483.5 km2.
Clear observation: Cloud Score+ `cs` band >= 0.60, the single definition used everywhere.

## Step 0, gate G-0: clear observation count

Run: `python scripts/step0_observations.py --project <EE_PROJECT>` on 2026-09-14.

Counts are distinct acquisition dates on which a 10m pixel was clear, sampled over pixels that the same year's CDL labels corn or soybean. 10,000 pixels requested per year, seed 42.

| year | acquisition dates | p10 | p25 | median | p75 | p90 | AOI under 2+ orbits |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2017 | 26 | 5 | 6 | 11 | 13 | 14 | 65% |
| 2018 | 58 | 10 | 12 | 22 | 25 | 26 | 64% |
| 2019 | 61 | 8 | 8 | 19 | 21 | 23 | 64% |
| 2020 | 61 | 12 | 13 | 25 | 27 | 29 | 65% |
| 2021 | 60 | 16 | 17 | 32 | 35 | 36 | 64% |
| 2022 | 61 | 12 | 13 | 25 | 28 | 29 | 64% |
| 2023 | 61 | 17 | 18 | 30 | 33 | 34 | 64% |
| 2024 | 60 | 17 | 18 | 29 | 32 | 34 | 65% |
| 2025 | 67 | 15 | 17 | 24 | 29 | 31 | 64% |

Median across years: 25. Worst year: 2017, median 11. Threshold: 6.

**G-0 passes.** The median exceeds the threshold by roughly four times in every year, and the tenth percentile exceeds it in every year except 2017.

### Finding 1: 2017 is not comparable to the other seasons

2017 yielded 26 acquisition dates against roughly 60 in every subsequent year, and its tenth percentile of 5 is the only value in the table below the G-0 threshold. Sentinel-2B did not reach operational service until mid-2017, so most of that season was single-satellite.

2017 is excluded. The usable record is 2018 to 2025, eight seasons.

### Finding 2: observation density varies about twofold across a hard spatial boundary

Two Sentinel-2 relative orbits cover the AOI. Orbit 69 covers 100% of the county; orbit 112 covers 65% of it. Measured for 2020: 32 scenes from orbit 69 and 30 from orbit 112.

Consistently across all nine years, 64% to 65% of the AOI falls under both orbits and the remainder under one. This produces the bimodal distribution visible in the table: for 2020, the tenth and twenty-fifth percentiles sit at 12 and 13 observations while the median and seventy-fifth sit at 25 and 27.

The boundary is drawn by orbit geometry and has no agronomic meaning. Zones on the thin side receive roughly half the observations, which gives them noisier baselines, shorter achievable persistence runs for S5, and less chance of catching a short-lived anomaly. Pooling the two regions would let a satellite artifact appear as a spatial pattern in crop stress.

**Decided 2026-09-14: the AOI is restricted to the doubly covered region**, that is Story County intersected with the footprint of relative orbit 112. Carrying coverage as a per-zone covariate was rejected because the thin region is a contiguous stripe rather than a random sample, so the confound would be spatial and would attach to every downstream comparison. About a third of the fields are dropped. The excluded stripe is retained as an optional robustness experiment: does ranking quality degrade at half the observation density? See `DESIGN.md` D18.

### Finding 3: effective per-crop history is two to four seasons, not eight

Measured over 2018 to 2025 on 4,000 sampled pixels at 30m, of which 2,892 were corn or soybean in at least six of the eight years.

| quantity | p10 | median | p90 |
|---|---|---|---|
| corn seasons per pixel | 4 | 4 | 6 |
| soybean seasons per pixel | 2 | 4 | 4 |

Crop changes across 82% of consecutive year pairs, and 49.3% of pixels alternate in every single year. The rotation is strong but not universal.

Because the baseline may use only years strictly prior to the target year, and because SPEC Section 8 stratified the baseline by crop at the time this was measured, the depth actually available to a held-out year was lower than the totals above:

| test year | prior seasons | approximate seasons per crop |
|---|---|---|
| 2023 | 5 (2018 to 2022) | 2 to 3 |
| 2024 | 6 (2018 to 2023) | 3 |
| 2025 | 7 (2018 to 2024) | 3 to 4 |

This triggers open item 12 of `docs/reviews/2026-09-14-council-label-review.md`, which recorded in advance that a measured per-zone-crop count materially below four would put the per-zone baseline itself in question, not merely the per-zone standard deviation already rejected.

**Decided 2026-09-14: crop stratification is dropped in favour of a within-field relative baseline.** Crop is a property of the field-year, not of the zone, because Corn Belt fields rotate as whole units. Measuring each zone against its own field median in the same year cancels crop, weather, planting date and management together, so the baseline can pool every prior year and usable history returns to five to seven seasons. Formulas in `SPEC.md` Section 8; reasoning in `DESIGN.md` D17 and `docs/reviews/2026-09-14-baseline-depth-decision.md`.

A zone-by-crop interaction, where a zone's relative standing genuinely differs between corn and soybean years, is not cancelled by this. Soybean iron deficiency chlorosis on the calcareous soils of the Des Moines Lobe is a plausible local mechanism. It is handled as a candidate refinement admitted by measured lift, not by assumption, and the across-zone corn-versus-soybean correlation is reported from Step 2 as a diagnostic: `[TBD]`.

## Step 0, zone size

`[TBD]`. Moved into Step 1. The Earth Engine expression that exports the zone table can emit 10m and 30m at negligible extra cost, and the comparison should be made on the within-field relative quantity that finding 3 settled. Prior expectation, recorded so it can be checked against the result: 30m will show lower year-over-year variance for stable zones, because it averages down Sentinel-2 co-registration jitter of roughly one pixel between passes.

## Step 1 onward

`[TBD]`. Not started.
